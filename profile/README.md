## Traveloka OCR

Nowadays, many mobile applications still ask users to input their personal information manually, proven by the case that offered by Traveloka for company-based-capstone project, OCR for KTP Validation, where the Traveloka app itself still requires users to input their personal data from KTP. We feel that typing personal information can be inconvenient and prone to error. Therefore, we want to tackle this problem by building an implemented OCR technology application for users to capture their KTP and automatically retrieve the information. It will improve user experience by saving userâ€™s time and effort.
