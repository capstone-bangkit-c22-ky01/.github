## Traveloka OCR

Nowadays, a lot of mobile applications still ask users to input their personal information manually. Therefore, we want to tackle this problem because typing personal information for administrative purposes in a mobile application can be inconvenient and prone to error processes for users. 

Our team's approach to tackling this problem is by capturing their ID card and then retrieving information from it by using OCR. This way, user can save their time and effort from manually typing their personal information.

This project is made to fulfill the **[Traveloka Singapore](https://www.traveloka.com/en-sg/) x [Bangkit Academy led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/)** Company Capstone.
